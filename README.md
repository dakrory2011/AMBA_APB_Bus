# AMBA APB Bus – RTL Design & UVM Verification

A complete implementation of the **AMBA Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)** protocol in **Verilog**, accompanied by a **UVM-based verification environment** featuring constrained-random verification, assertions, functional coverage, and a scoreboard.

---

## Overview

This project implements a complete APB subsystem consisting of:

- APB Master
- Address Decoder
- Response Multiplexer
- Four APB Slaves
- Register-based Memory
- UVM Verification Environment

The verification environment was developed following industry-standard UVM methodology to validate protocol compliance, functional correctness, and corner-case behavior.

# Features

## RTL Design

- APB Master implementing the APB protocol
- Four APB Slave peripherals
- Address Decoder
- Response Multiplexer
- Register File implementation
- Wait-state support using **PREADY**
- Error response generation using **PSLVERR**
- Byte write support (**PSTRB**)
- Protection attributes (**PPROT**)

---

## Verification Environment

The verification environment includes:

- UVM Test
- UVM Environment
- UVM Agent
- Sequencer
- Driver
- Monitor
- Scoreboard
- Functional Coverage Collector
- Assertions (SVA)

---

# Verification Features

The following scenarios are verified:

- Reset behavior
- Single Write Transaction
- Single Read Transaction
- Back-to-Back Transfers
- Random Read/Write Transactions
- Invalid Address Access
- Wait-State Handling
- Error Response (PSLVERR)
- Address Decoder Operation
- Multiplexer Response Selection
- Register Read/Write Functionality
- APB Handshake Timing

---

# Functional Coverage

Coverage is collected for:

- Read vs Write operations
- All APB Slaves
- Valid addresses
- Invalid addresses
- Byte enable combinations
- Protection attribute combinations
- Wait-state scenarios
- Error responses
- Reset events
- Transaction type × Slave selection
- Transaction type × Error response
- Slave × Wait-state cross coverage

---

# Assertions

SystemVerilog Assertions are used to verify protocol correctness, including:

- Reset clears outputs
- SETUP phase behavior
- ACCESS phase behavior
- Transaction completion
- PSEL assertion
- PENABLE timing
- Read transaction protocol
- Write transaction protocol
- Wait-state handling
- Invalid address response
- Decoder correctness
- Signal stability during ACCESS

# APB Address Map

| Slave | Address Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Slave 0 | 0x0000 – 0x0FFF |
| Slave 1 | 0x1000 – 0x1FFF |
| Slave 2 | 0x2000 – 0x2FFF |
| Slave 3 | 0x3000 – 0x3FFF |

# Simulation

Compile the design and UVM environment:

```tcl
vlib work
vlog -f src_files.list
vsim top
run -all
```

Or simply execute:

```tcl
do run.do
```
